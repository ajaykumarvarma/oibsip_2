            “Google CEO Sundar Pichai is a computer engineer. Google, Alphabet Inc.'s largest corporation, named Pichai CEO. Pichai joined Google in 2004 as a product manager and oversaw innovation initiatives for Google Chrome and Chrome OS, which were successful. He quickly climbed to handle other Google products including Gmail and Google Docs. Pichai was smart and creative from childhood in Chennai, India. After graduating from top universities, he worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and management consulting at McKinsey & Company before joining Google. Pichai, who leads Google's most significant products, is appreciated by his coworkers. In 2014, Pichai was considered for Microsoft CEO, but Satya Nadella won. "I saw this coming," his ecstatic professor Sanat Roy told the Times of India.”

        <h1 class="hc-head">His Success at Google</h1>
        <div class="legacy">
            <p class="uldesign">Sundar Pichai's interview at Google coincidently coincided with the launch of Google Gmail. Unaware of the new product, Pichai admitted his ignorance during his interviews and is remembered as the candidate with "intellectual humility," which Laszlo Bock, Google’s former senior VP of people operations, called one of the top qualities he looked for in candidates at Google. Pichai was well-prepared but managed a dynamic situation with candor during a moment of uncertainty</p>
            <br></br>
            <p class="uldesign">On April 1, 2004, Sundar Pichai joined Google as its vice-president of product management and was tasked with the development of Google Toolbar and Google Chrome, which grew to become the world’s most popular internet browser.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p class="uldesign">Pichai launched the Chrome OS and Chromebook in 2011, headed the Android operating system in 2013, and became the leader of all products and engineering at Google by 2014. Pichai oversaw all of Google’s products and platforms, including Search, Maps, Play, Android, Chrome, Gmail, and Google Workspace.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p class="uldesign">Under Pichai's leadership, Google invested in new opportunities such as Google Cloud and YouTube and continues to research advanced technologies, including machine learning and quantum computing. In 2021, Sundar Pichai stated that artificial intelligence, when machines are programmed to simulate the human mind and solve problems and mimic human activity, "will have a bigger impact than most of the breakthroughs in recent history" and "can make humans more productive than we ever imagined." Pichai expects AI to play a foundational role in every aspect of our lives, by mimicking human tasks, from healthcare and education to how we manufacture things and consume information.</p>
            <br></br>
            <p class="uldesign">In 2021, Alphabet crossed $2 trillion in market value due to sales and profit growth during the COVID-19 pandemic. While many other technology giants embrace the metaverse as the next frontier of growth, Sundar Pichai sees Google’s future in its oldest offering, the Internet search, with consumers asking computers more questions with voice and multimodal experiences.</p>
